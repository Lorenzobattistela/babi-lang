# Babi lang

This language project aims to study language design and compilers, and to have fun. It is a toy language, and it is not intended to be used in production. It is a work in progress, and it is not ready for use. This project was inspired by [Bolt](https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt) and the series of articles by Mukul Rathi https://mukulrathi.com/create-your-own-programming-language/intro-to-type-checking/ .
